# Navigation-Bar

1. The project does not require any external dependencies other than a modern browser to view the menu.
   Open index.html in your browser to check the run process:
   Hover over dropdown menu items and ensure they display correctly.
   Verify hover effects and smooth transitions.
   Resize the browser to 768px or smaller.
   Click the hamburger menu to toggle navigation links.

2. For enhance user experience, I developed visual and interactive design:
   Buttons and links have increased padding and touch targets, ensuring ease of use on mobile and tablet devices.
   All menu items, including dropdowns, are accessible using the Tab key, allowing users with limited mobility to navigate seamlessly
   The color palette is chosen to provide sufficient contrast, ensuring text remains readable for users with visual impairments.
   The design starts with the smallest screen sizes, scaling up to larger devices using media queries.

3. Used for the hamburger menu icon from RemixIcon.  The simple icons would ensure that the navigation menu is lightweight, responsive, 
   and accessible

4. The CityNews Calgary website has a clean and professional design optimized for delivering news content, such as Sticky Navigation Bar, Dropdown Menus, Clear Fonts and High Contrast.
